# ONiT: Image Extraction
This repository contains a CSV with a collection of images from the ONiT corpus that were automatically extracted from the digitized bookprints with the [Illustration Detector tool](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/blob/master/Illustration-Detector.md) by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford.

The present version of this collection contains all images extracted with the tool by the end of the first project year. The goal of the interdisciplinary ONiT project [Ottoman Nature in Travelogues (ONiT)](https://onit.oeaw.ac.at/) is to analyze Ottoman “nature” in travelogues on the Ottoman empire, printed between 1501 and 1850.

A collection of direct links leading to all extracted images at the [Austrian National Library](https://search.onb.ac.at/) IIIF repository are provided in the CSV/Excel files:
