# ONiT: Image Extraction
This repository contains links to the images from the ONiT corpus that were extracted with the [Illustration Detector tool](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/blob/master/Illustration-Detector.md) by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford.

Direct links to the [Austrian National Library](https://search.onb.ac.at/) IIIF repository of all extracted images that were extracted until the end of the first project year are provided. The interdisciplinary project [Ottoman Nature in Travelogues (ONiT)](https://onit.oeaw.ac.at/) analyzes Ottoman “nature” in travelogues on the Ottoman empire, printed between 1501 and 1850.
