# ONiT: Image Extraction
This repository contains a CSV with a collection of images from the ONiT corpus that were extracted from the digitized bookprints with the [Illustration Detector tool](https://gitlab.com/vgg/nls-chapbooks-illustrations/-/blob/master/Illustration-Detector.md) by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford.

The present version of this collection contains all digitized prints extracted until the end of the first project year. The interdisciplinary project [Ottoman Nature in Travelogues (ONiT)](https://onit.oeaw.ac.at/) analyzes Ottoman “nature” in travelogues on the Ottoman empire, printed between 1501 and 1850.

A collection of direct links to the [Austrian National Library](https://search.onb.ac.at/) IIIF repository leading to all extracted images are provided in the CSV/Excel files:
